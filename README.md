# ASIR_GURU
ASIR Open Platform is a hierarchical collection of open source projcet, which is called ASIR-GURU. It inlcudes two learning-based projects, two innovative-based projects, and a practical tool-set.

## ROSE
Robotics Study Environment(ROSE) is a learning and simulation Environment based on Matlab and CoppeliaSim, includes several open courses with matierials, exercises.
And an algorithm collection fromm ASIR and other researcher or organizer haved published.
